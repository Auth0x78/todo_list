Here's a sample `README.md` file for your Todo App repository:

# Todo App

A minimal, client-side Todo App built with React, TypeScript, and Next.js, designed to help users manage tasks with a straightforward interface. This app includes light/dark mode toggle without storing user theme preferences, and uses local storage for persisting todos.

## Features

- Add and delete todos
- Mark todos as complete or incomplete
- Light/dark mode toggle (non-persistent across sessions)
- Todos are saved in local storage, ensuring tasks are available across reloads

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app in your browser.

## Usage

1. **Add a Todo:**
   - Type a task in the input field and hit "Enter" or click "Add."
   
2. **Complete a Todo:**
   - Click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as complete or incomplete.
   
3. **Delete a Todo:**
   - Click the trash icon next to the task to delete it.
   
4. **Toggle Theme:**
   - Use the theme toggle button at the top of the app to switch between light and dark mode. This will reset upon reload.
